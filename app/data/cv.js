      `
Hi 👋 ! my name is Arsam and I am a software engineer. I live in Oxford England and work fulltime as Lead Frontend Architect at Sensyne Health in the Oxford Science Park.

I have been designing and developing websites and web applications since late 2012. I am currently focusing on creating applications using Javascript both on front and the backend. my Favourite frameworks are React for the frontend and Express for the backend. I have a keen interest on working with GraphQL in a commercial project and apply my expertise in a large scale application.

I have recently started to learn about "machine learning" and am eagerly expanding my knowledge of AI, VR, and AR.
