  About: [
    `Hi ðŸ‘‹  My name is Arsam. I am a Highly skilled and results-driven
Software Engineer with over 10 of experience in developing and
delivering complex software solutions. Proficient in modern frontend
technologies and frameworks, including React, NextJs, Svelte, Sveltekit
and more!

I have a proven track record of building scalable, user-friendly,
and visually appealing applications; and the ability to work collaboratively
in cross-functional teams and lead projects from concept to deployment.

I am committed to staying current with industry trends and advancements
to ensure delivery of top-quality solutions.

As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I am eager to take on new
challenges and responsibilities, and I believe that a Principal Engineer
or Staff Engineer role, where I can leverage my expertise in frontend
development to lead and guide teams, would be the perfect next step in
my career.`
